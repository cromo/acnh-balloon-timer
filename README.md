# ACNH Balloon Timer

A web page to help grind balloon spawns in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

## Why?

If you're like me, you want to get all the cherry blossom recipes but don't want to run up and down the beach for hours on end. Even with the knowledge that balloons spawn every five minutes, you're still checking the clock too frequently to be able to focus on anything else in the meantime. This web page can be left running in your peripheral vision and will float a treasure across the screen when it's time to scan for new balloons. In effect, this substitutes our ability to see motion (very good) for our ability to sense the passage of time (somewhat rough).
